# Vehicle State Estimation

[![Project Status: Active â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

The goal of this project is to design and implement a vehicle state estimator using a linear Kalman Filter, an extended Kalman filter, an Unscented Kalman Filter, and a Cubature Kalman Filter.

The vehicle state estimation and localization is calculated using two [Intertial Measurement Units](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST_BNO055_DS000_12.pdf) and one [GPS sensor](https://www.swiftnav.com/latest/piksi-multi-hw-specification). 

## Requirements
The code is based on Python3 (>=3.8). There are a few dependencies to run the code. The major libraries are listed as follows:
* Numpy (>=1.20.0)
* Matplotlib (>=3.4.0)
* PyYAML (>=5.4)

## Installation Guide
To install the anaconda environment, navigate to the repository folder, and run the following command in the terminal:

```
$conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Execution Guide
1. To activate the Conda environment, please run the following command in the terminal:

```
$conda activate kalman
```

2. *To be added*

3. To deactivate the Conda environment, please run the following command in the terminal:

```
$conda deactivate
```

## Clean-up Guide
To remove the anaconda environment, navigate to the repository folder, and run the following command in the terminal:

```
conda remove --name kalman --all
```
